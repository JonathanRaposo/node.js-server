This is a node.js server with no framework or libraries. This app does the basic CRUD operations.It contains a custom body parser function (it parses the body in the request), a url query string function( it parses the url encoded string), an id generator function (it generates unique ids), etc.Furthermore,the app is able to provide static files such as images and css. <img width="1424" alt="Screen Shot 2025-02-05 at 12 37 42 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad058b8c-4dda-40d5-a242-d2d497a4ef8d" />


 I want to showcase how you can utilize the node js file system to read and write files.Instead of using a external database client, I created a database service class that interacts with a custom database.it Also features a search bar to look up a company. ![Screen Shot 2025-02-05 at 1 09 43 AM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0fb66f88-1d8e-465a-ac93-a0b977c09d2d)
