This is a node.js server with no framework or libraries. This app does the basic CRUD operations.It contains a custom body parser function (it parses the body in the request), a url query string function( it parses the url encoded string), a id generator function, etc. The app also is able to provide static files such as images and css. I want to showcase how you can utilize the node js file system to read and write files. <img width="1424" alt="Screen Shot 2025-02-05 at 12 37 42 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad058b8c-4dda-40d5-a242-d2d497a4ef8d" />
